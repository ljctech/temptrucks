    body = """Hello %s,

    I know that State Farm has the best rates for commercial trucks that are filed in specific way with the department of transportation's SAFER site.

    How would you like the ability to generate a list based on their data?

    For example:

        Trucking companies who are filed with the DOT on the SAFER site as:
            Intrastate,
            Beverages,
            In your territoryâ€™s zip code.

    Visit www.trucksearch.us and for only $19.99 a month you can generate a custom commercial report. The site is updated weekly with new DOT filings

    Regards
